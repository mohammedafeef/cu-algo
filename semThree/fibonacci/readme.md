Problem: Python Program to Print the Fibonacci sequence
Details: We initialize the first term to 0 and the second term to 1. 
         If the number of terms is more than 2, 
         we use a while loop to find the next term in the sequence by adding the preceding two terms.
         We then interchange the variables (update it) and continue on with the process.
